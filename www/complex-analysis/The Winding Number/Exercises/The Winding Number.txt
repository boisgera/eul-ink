Star-Shaped Sets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question

Prove that every open star-shaped subset of $\mathbb{C}$ is simply connected.

### Answer

Let $\Omega$ be an open star-shaped subset of $\mathbb{C}$ with a center $c$.

For any $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$ and any $s\geq 0$, 
the point $w = z + s (z - c)$ belongs to $\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega.$
The ray of all such points $w$ is unbounded and connected, 
thus it is included in an unbounded component of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$.
All components of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$ are therefore unbounded: 
$\Omega$ is simply connected.

Alternatively, let $\gamma$ be a closed path of $\Omega$ and
let $z = c + r e^{i\alpha} \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$.
Since the ray $\{z + s e^{i\alpha} \; | \; s \geq 0\}$ 
does not intersect $\Omega$, 
for any $t \in [0,1]$ and any $s\geq 0$, $\gamma(t) - z \neq s e^{i\alpha}$.
Thus $e^{-i(\pi + \alpha)}(\gamma(t) - z) \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \mathbb{R}_-$
and the function
  $$
  \phi: t \in [0,1] 
  \mapsto 
  e^{i(\pi+\alpha)}\arg (e^{-i(\pi+\alpha)}(\gamma(t) - z))
  $$
is defined; since it is a continuous choice of the argument 
$w \mapsto \mathrm{Arg} (w - z)$ along $\gamma$, 
  $$
  \mathrm{ind}(\gamma, z) = \frac{1}{2\pi}[\phi(1) - \phi(0)] = 0.
  $$ 
Therefore, $\Omega$ is simply connected.


The Argument Principle for Polynomials
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Questions

Let $p$ be the polynomial
  $$
  p(z) = \lambda \times (z - a_1)^{n_1} \times \dots \times (z-a_m)^{n_m}
  $$
where $\lambda$ is a nonzero complex number,
$a_1, \dots, a_m$ are distinct complex numbers 
(the *zeros* or *roots* of the polynomial)
and $n_1, \dots, n_{m}$ are positive natural numbers
(the roots *orders* or *multiplicities*).
Let $\gamma$ be a closed path whose image contains no root of $p$:
  $$
  \forall \, t \in [0,1], \; 
  p(\gamma(t)) \neq 0.
  $$
The argument principle then states that
  $$
  \mathrm{ind}(p \circ \gamma, 0) 
  = 
  \sum_{k=1}^m \mathrm{ind}(\gamma, a_{k}) \times n_{k}.
  $$


 1. **Application: Finding the Roots of a Polynomial.** 

    Use the figures below to determine -- 
    according to the argument principle --
    the number of roots $z$ of the polynomial $p(z) = z^3 + z + 1$ 
    in the open unit disk centered on the origin.


    ![Graph of $t \in [0,1] \mapsto 
    \mathrm{arg} \left[ (e^{i2\pi t})^3 + (e^{i2\pi t}) + 1 \right]$;
    this function has a jump of $-2 \pi$ at $t=0.5$
    (where it is undefined). 
    The dashed line represents a continuous choice of the argument
    of $t \in [0,1] \mapsto (e^{i2\pi t})^3 + (e^{i2\pi t}) + 1$.](images/argument_principle.pdf)

    ![Graph of $t \in [0,1] \mapsto |(e^{i2\pi t})^3 + (e^{i2\pi t}) + 1|$.](images/modulus.pdf)

 2. **Argument Principle Proof (Elementary).** 
    For any $k \in \{1, \dots, m\}$, we denote $\theta_{k}$ 
    a continous choice of $z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg}(z-a_{k})$ on $\gamma$.
    Use the functions $\theta_{k}$ to build a continuous choice of 
    $z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg} \, z$ on $p \circ \gamma$;
    then, prove the argument principle.

 3. **Argument Principle Proof (Complex Analysis).**
    Assume that $\gamma$ is rectifiable;
    write the winding number $\mathrm{ind}(p \circ \gamma, 0)$ 
    as a line integral, 
    then find another way to prove the argument principle in this context.


<!--
The Python code that was used to generate these figures 
relies on [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) for computing
and on [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) to display 
function graphs.

    from numpy import *
    from matplotlib.pyplot import *
 
The polynomial $p$ and the path $\gamma$, 
are implemented as Python functions:

    def p(z):
        return (z * z * z) + z + 1.0

    def gamma(t):
        return exp(1j * 2 * pi * t)

We build a uniform partition of $[0,1]$ into $1000$ intervals 
ans sample the values of the function $p \circ \gamma$ accordingly:

    t = linspace(0.0, 1.0, 1000 + 1)
    p_gamma_t = p(gamma(t))

We display the principal value of the argument of $p \circ \gamma$,
and a continuous choice of the argument of $p \circ \gamma$ 
(with a dashed line):

    plot(t, angle(p_gamma_t))
    plot(t, unwrap(angle(p_gamma_t)), "--")

In a new figure, we plot the modulus of $p \circ \gamma$:

    figure()
    plot(t, abs(p_gamma_t))
-->

### Answers

 1. Let $\gamma: t \in [0,1] \mapsto e^{i2\pi t}$;
    we have $(p \circ \gamma)(t) = (e^{i2\pi t})^3 + (e^{i2\pi t}) + 1$.
    The second figure shows that the graph of $t \mapsto |(p\circ \gamma)(t)|$ 
    does not vanish on $[0,1]$, 
    hence the image of $\gamma$ contains no root of $p$.
    The second figure shows that the variation of the argument of $z$ 
    on the path $p \circ \gamma$ is $2\pi$ 
    (a variation of $\pi$ between $t=0$ and $t=0.5$ and also
    a variation of $\pi$ between $t=0.5$ and $t=1.0$).
    Accordingly, we have $$\mathrm{ind}(p \circ \gamma, 0) = 1.$$

    On the other hand, every zero $z$ of $p$ such that $|z|<1$ satisfies
    $\mathrm{ind}(\gamma, z) = 1$ and every zero $z$ of $p$ such that $|z|>1$ 
    satisfies $\mathrm{ind}(\gamma, z) = 0$. 
    Consequently, the expression
      $$
      \sum_{k=1}^m \mathrm{ind}(\gamma, a_{k}) \times n_{k}
      $$
    provides the number of roots of $p$ -- 
    counted with their multiplicity -- 
    within the unit circle. 
    By the argument principle, there is a unique root of $p$ within the unit
    circle.

 2. If $\theta_0$ is an argument of $\lambda$, the sum
      $$
      \theta: t \in [0,1] \mapsto \theta_0 + n_1 \theta_1(t) \times \dots + n_m \theta_{m}(t)
      $$
    is continuous and
      $$
      \begin{split}
      e^{i\theta(t)} = &\, e^{i\theta_0} \times e^{i n_1\theta_1(t)} \times 
      \dots \times e^{i n_m \theta_m(t)} \\
      = &\,
      \frac{\lambda}{|\lambda|} \times \frac{(\gamma(t) - a_1)^{n_1}}{|\gamma(t) - a_1|^{n_1}} \times \dots \times \frac{(\gamma(t) - a_m)^{n_m}}{|\gamma(t) - a_m|^{n_m}} \\
      = &\,
      \frac{(p \circ \gamma)(t)}{|(p \circ \gamma)(t)|},
      \end{split}
      $$
    therefore $\theta$ is a choice of the argument of $z \mapsto z$ on $p \circ \gamma$.
    Consequently,
      $$
      \begin{split}
      [z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg} \, z]_{p \circ \gamma} 
      &= \, 
      \theta(1) - \theta(0) \\
      &= \, 
      \theta_0 - \theta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^m n_{k}(\theta_{k}(1) - \theta_{k}(0)) \\
      &= \,
      \sum_{k=1}^{m} n_{k}  \times [z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg} (z-a_{k})]_{\gamma}.
      \end{split}
      $$
    A division of both sides of this equation by $2\pi$ concludes the proof.

 3. The integral expression of the winding number is
      $$
      \mathrm{ind}(p \circ \gamma, 0)
      =
      \frac{1}{i2\pi} \int_{p \circ \gamma} \frac{dz}{z}.
      $$
    The polynomial $p$ is holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}$, 
    hence we can perform the change of variable $z = p(w)$,
    which yields
      $$
      \mathrm{ind}(p \circ \gamma, 0)
      =
      \frac{1}{i2\pi} \int_{\gamma} \frac{p'(w)}{p(w)} dw.
      $$
    If we factor $p(w)$ as $(w-a_{k})^{n_{k}} q(w)$, we see that
      $$
      \frac{p'(w)}{p(w)} =  \frac{n_{k}}{w-a_{k}} + \frac{q'(w)}{q(w)};
      $$ 
    applying this process repeatedly for every $k \in \{1,\dots,m\}$, 
    until $q$ is a constant, provides
      $$
      \frac{p'(w)}{p(w)} = \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{n_{k}}{w-a_{k}}
      $$
   and consequently
      $$
      \begin{split}
      \mathrm{ind}(p \circ \gamma, 0)
      = &\,
      \frac{1}{i2\pi}\int_{\gamma} \left[ \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{n_{k}}{w-a_{k}}\right] dw \\
      = &\,
      \sum_{k=1}^m \left[\frac{1}{i2\pi}\int_{\gamma} \frac{dw}{w-a_{k}}\right] \times n_{k} \\
      = &\,  \sum_{k=1}^m \mathrm{ind}(\gamma, a_{k}) \times n_{k}.
      \end{split}
      $$

Set Operations & Simply Connected Sets 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Questions

Suppose that $A$, $B$ and $\mathbb{C} \setminus C$ are open subsets of $\mathbb{C}.$
For each of the three statements below, 

  - determine whether or not the statement is true
    (either prove it or provide a counter-example);

  - if the statement is false, find a sensible assumption that makes 
    the new statement true (and provide a proof).

The statements are:
    
 1. **Intersection.**
    The intersection $A \cap B$ of two simply connected sets $A$ and $B$ 
    is simply connected.

 2. **Complement.**
    The relative complement $A \setminus C$ 
    of a connected set $C$ in a simply connected set $A$ 
    is simply connected. 

 3. **Union.**
    The union $A \cup B$ of two connected and simply connected sets 
    $A$ and $B$ is simply connected.


### Answers

 1. **Intersection.**
    The statement holds true.
    Indeed, let $\gamma$ be a closed path of $A \cap B$; 
    it is a path of $A$ and a path of $B$.
    As both sets are simply connected, 
    the interior of $\gamma$ is included in $A$ and in $B$,
    that is in $A \cap B$: this intersection is simply connected.

    Alternatively, let $C$ be a component of 
      $$
      \mathbb{C} \setminus (A \cap B) 
      = (\mathbb{C} \setminus A) \cup (\mathbb{C} \setminus B),
      $$
    and let $z \in C;$
    we have $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus A$ or $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus B$.
    If $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus A$, the component of $\mathbb{C} \setminus A$
    that contains $z$ is unbounded; it is a connected set that contains $z$ and
    is included in $\mathbb{C} \setminus (A \cap B)$, hence, it is also included
    in $C$. Consequently, $C$ is unbounded. 
    If instead $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus B$, a similar argument provides the
    same result.
    Consequently, all components of $\mathbb{C} \setminus (A \cap B)$ are 
    unbounded: $A \cap B$ is simply connected. 

 2. **Complement.**
    The statement does not hold: consider $A = D(0,3)$ and 
    $C = \overline{D(0,1)}$.
    The set $A$ is open and simply connected and the set $C$ is closed and 
    connected. 
    The set $C$ is actually a component of $A \setminus C$:
    it is included in $A \setminus C$, connected and maximal.
    
    However, the statement holds if additionally
    the set $C \setminus A$ is not empty.
    Let $\gamma$ be a closed path of $A \setminus C$ and
    let $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus (A \setminus C)$.
    If $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus A$, as $A$ is simply connected,
    $z$ belongs to the exterior of $\gamma$.
    Otherwise, $z \in A \cap C$;
    as $C$ is a connected subset that does not intersect the image of $\gamma$,
    the function $w \in C \mapsto \mathrm{ind}(\gamma, w)$ is constant.
    There is a $w \in C \setminus A$ and 
    $\mathrm{ind} (\gamma, z)=\mathrm{ind} (\gamma, w) = 0$.
    Therefore $z$ also belongs to the exterior of $\gamma$:
    $A \setminus C$ is simply connected.
    
    Alternatively, let $D$ be a component of 
      $$
      \mathbb{C} \setminus (A \setminus C) = (\mathbb{C} \setminus A) \cup C.
      $$
    Some of its elements are in $\mathbb{C} \setminus A$: 
    otherwise, $C$ would be a connected superset of $D$ that is included in
    $\mathbb{C} \setminus (A \setminus C)$; we would have $C=D$ and therefore
    $C \setminus A$ would be empty.
    Now, as $D$ contains at least a point $z$ of $\mathbb{C} \setminus A$,
    it contains the component of $\mathbb{C} \setminus A$ that contains $z$;
    therefore $D$ is unbounded. 
    Consequently, $A \setminus C$ is simply connected.

 3. **Union.**
    The statement doesn't hold: consider
      $$
      A_s = \{2e^{i 2 \pi t} \; | \; t \in [0, 1/2]\}, \;
      B_s = \{2e^{i 2 \pi t} \; | \; t \in [1/2, 1]\}.
      $$
    and the associated dilations
      $$
      A = \{z \in \mathbb{C} \; | \; d(z, A_s) < 1 \}, \;
      B = \{z\in \mathbb{C} \; | \; d(z, B_s) < 1 \}.
      $$
    They are both open, connected and simply connected 
    (their complement in the plane has a single path-connected component 
    and it is unbounded) 
    but their union $A \cup B$ is the annulus $D(0,3) \setminus D(0,1)$.
    We already considered this set in question 2: it is not simply connected.
        
    However, the statement holds if additionally,
    the intersection $A \cap B$ is connected.
    Let $\gamma$ be a closed path of $A \cup B$
    and let $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus (A \cap B)$. 
    We have to prove that $\mathrm{ind}(\gamma, z) = 0$.   

    <!--
    We notice first that $A$ and $B$ may be replaced by sets $A$ and $B$
    that satisfy the same assumption but additionally are connected.
    Indeed, the image of $\gamma$ is included in at most one component
    $A$ of $A$ and $B$ of $B$;
    unless this image does not intersect $A$ or $B$
    (in which case $\mathrm{ind}(\gamma, z) = 0$ is obvious),
    $A \cup B$ is path-connected, 
    hence the "Disjoint Union of Open Sets" theorem yields 
    that $A \cap B$ is not empty. 
    The set $A \cap B$ is a non-empty subset of $A \cap B$;
    let $w \in A \cap B$.
    Any connected subset of $A$ that contains $w$ is a subset of $A$
    and any connected subset of $B$ that contains $w$ is a subset $B$;
    hence, $A \cap B$ is a subset of $A \cap B$ and therefore
    $A \cap B = A \cap B$ is a non-empty connected set. 
    -->

    There exist[^Lebesgue] a sequence $(\gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_n)$ of consecutive
    paths of $A \cup B$ whose concatenation is $\gamma$ and such that for
    any $k \in \{1,\dots, n\}$, $\gamma_{k}([0,1]) \subset A$
    or $\gamma_{k}([0,1]) \subset B$.
    
    [^Lebesgue]: The collection $\{A, B\}$ is an open cover of 
      $\gamma([0,1])$ which is compact. 
      Now, for any positive integer $n$, consider the sequence
      $(\gamma^n_1, \dots, \gamma^n_n)$ where 
        $$
        \gamma^n_k(t) = \gamma((k-1+t)/n).
        $$
      By uniform continuity of $\gamma$, the diameters of the 
      $\gamma^n_k$ tends uniformly to zero when $n$ tends to $+\infty$.
      The conclusion follows from [Lebesgue's Number Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue's_number_lemma).

    Let $a_{k}$ be the initial point of $\gamma_{k}$ and let 
    $w \in A \cap B$. 
    As $A$, $B$ and $A \cap B$ are connected, 
    for any $k \in \{1,\dots, n\}$, 
    there is a path $\beta_{k}$ from $w$ to $a_{k}$ such that
    $\beta_{k}([0,1]) \subset A$ if $a_{k} \in A$ and
    $\beta_{k} ([0,1]) \subset B$ if $a_{k} \in B$.
    We denote $\beta_{n+1}=\beta_1$ for convenience;
    define the paths $\alpha_{k}$ as the concatenations
      $$
      \alpha_{k} = \beta_{k} \, | \, \gamma_{k} \, | \, \beta_{k+1}.
      $$
    By construction
      $$
      [x \mapsto \mathrm{Arg} (x-z)]_{\gamma}
      = \sum_{k=1}^{n} [x \mapsto \mathrm{Arg} (x-z)]_{\alpha_{k}}.
      $$
    Every path $\alpha_{k}$ is closed, hence this is equivalent to
      $$
      \mathrm{ind}(\gamma,z) =
      \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mathrm{ind}(\alpha_{k}, z),
      $$
    but every $\alpha_{k}$ belongs either to $A$ or $B$, 
    which are simply connected, 
    hence the right-hand-side is equal to zero.
    (This proof was adapted from [Ronnie Brown's argument on Math Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/208817))

    <!--
    Finally, in the general case where $A$ and $B$ may not be open, 
    even the new statement doesn't hold. Consider the sets
     $$
     A = \{z\in \mathbb{C} \; | \; \Re z <0 \},
     \;
     B = \{z\in \mathbb{C} \; | \; \Re z \geq 0 \} \setminus \{0\}.
     $$
    Both sets are simply connected, and their intersection, the empty set,
    is connected. However, their union is $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ which is not
    simply connected.
    -->
