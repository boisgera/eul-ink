Definitions
================================================================================

The argument of a non-zero complex number is only defined modulo $2\pi.$
A convenient way to describe mathematically this relationship is 
to associate to any such number the set of admissible values 
of its argument:

**Definition -- The Argument Function.** 
The *set-valued* (or *multi-valued*) function $\mathrm{Arg},$
defined on $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ by
  $$
  \mathrm{Arg} \, z 
  = 
  \left\{ 
    \theta \in \mathbb{R} 
    \; \left| \; 
    e^{i\theta} = \frac{z}{|z|} \right. 
  \right\},
  $$
is called the *argument* function.

If we need a classic *single-valued* function instead, we have for example:

**Definition -- Principal Value of the Argument.**
The *principal value of the argument* is the unique continuous function 
  $$
  \mathrm{arg}: \mathbb{C} \setminus \mathbb{R}_- \to \mathbb{R}
  $$
such that
  $$
  \arg \, 1 = 0
  $$
which is a *choice* of the argument on its domain:
  $$
  \forall \, z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \mathbb{R}_-, \;
  \mathrm{arg}\, z \in \mathrm{Arg}  \, z.
  $$

**Proof (existence and uniqueness).** 
Define $\mathrm{arg}$ on $\mathbb{C} \setminus \mathbb{R}_- \to \mathbb{R}$ by:
  $$
  \arg (x + i y) = 
  \left| 
  \begin{array}{cl}
  \arctan y/x & \mbox{if } x > 0, \\
  +\pi/2 - \arctan x/y & \mbox{if } y > 0, \\
  -\pi/2 - \arctan x/y & \mbox{if } y < 0. \\
  \end{array}
  \right.
  $$
This definition is non-ambiguous: if $x>0$ and $y>0,$ we have
  $$
  \arctan x/y + \arctan y/x = \pi/2
  $$
and a similar equality holds when $x>0$ and $y<0.$ 
As each of the three expressions used to define $\mathrm{arg}$ has an open
domain and is continuous, the function itself is continuous.
It is a choice of the argument thanks to the definition of $\arctan$: 
for example, if $x>0,$ with $\theta=\arg(x+iy),$ we have
  $$
  \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}=\tan \theta = \tan (\arctan y/x) = \frac{y}{x}, 
  $$
hence, as $\cos \theta > 0$ and $x>0,$ there is a $\lambda > 0$
such that
  $$
  x + i y = \lambda (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) = \lambda e^{i\theta},
  $$
This equation yields $\arg x+ i y \in \mathrm{Arg} \, x + iy.$ 
The proof for the half-planes $y>0$ and $y<0$ is similar.

If $f$ is another continuous choice of the argument 
on $\mathbb{C} \setminus \mathbb{R}_-$ such that $f(1) = 0,$ 
the image of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \mathbb{R}_-$ by the 
difference $f - \arg$ is a subset of $2\pi \mathbb{Z}$ that 
contains $0,$ and it's also path-connected as the image of a path-connected
set by a continuous function. Consequently, it is the singleton $\{0\}$:
$f$ and $\arg$ are equal.
\hfill $\blacksquare$

We cannot avoid the introduction of a *cut* in the complex plane when we
search for a continuous choice of the argument:
there is no continuous choice of the argument on $\mathbb{C}^*.$
However, for a continuous choice of the argument along a path of
$\mathbb{C}^*,$ there is no such restriction:

The following theorem is a special case of the path lifting property
(in the context of covering spaces; refer to [@Hat02] for details).

**Theorem -- Continuous Choice of the Argument.** 
Let $a \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\gamma$ be a path of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{a\}.$ 
Let $\theta_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ be a value of the argument of $\gamma(0) - a$:
  $$
  \theta_0 \in \mathrm{Arg}(\gamma(0) - a).
  $$
There is a unique continous function $\theta:[0,1] \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ such that 
$\theta(0) = \theta_0$ which is a *choice* of $z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg}(z-a)$ on $\gamma$:
  $$
  \forall \, t \in [0,1], \; 
  \theta(t) \in \mathrm{Arg}(\gamma(t) - a).
  $$

**Proof.** 
Let $(x(t), y(t))$ be the cartesian coordinates of $\gamma(t)$ in the system 
with origin $a$ and basis $(e^{i\theta_0}, i e^{i\theta_0}).$ 
As long as $x(t) > 0,$ the function 
  $$t \mapsto \theta_0 + \arg(x(t)+iy(t))$$
is a continuous choice of the argument of $\gamma(t) - a.$ 
Let $d$ be the distance between $a$ and $\gamma([0,1])$ 
and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
  $$
  |t - s| \leq 2^{-n} \, \Rightarrow \, |\gamma(t) - \gamma(s)| < d.
  $$
The condition $x(t) > 0$ is ensured for any $t$ in $[0, 2^{-n}].$
This construction of a continuous choice may be iterated locally on every 
interval $[k2^{-n}, (k+1)2^{-n}]$ with a new coordinate system to provide
a global continuous choice of the argument on $[0,1].$

The uniqueness of a continuous choice is a consequence of the intermediate
value theorem: if we assume that there are two such functions $\theta_1$ and
$\theta_2$ with the same initial value $\theta_0,$ as 
$\theta_1(0) - \theta_2(0)=0,$ if $\theta_1(t) - \theta_2(t) \neq 0$ for
some $t\in[0,1],$ then either $|\theta_1(t) - \theta_2(t)| < \pi,$ or 
there is a $\tau \in \left]0,t\right[$ such that 
$\theta_1(\tau) - \theta_2(\tau) \neq 0$ and 
$|\theta_1(\tau) -\theta_2(\tau)| < \pi.$
In any case, there is a contradiction since all values of the argument
differ of a multiple of $2\pi.$ \hfill $\blacksquare$

**Definition -- Variation of the Argument.** 
Let $a \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\gamma$ be a path of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{a\}.$
The *variation* of $z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg}(z-a)$ on $\gamma$ is defined as
  $$
  [z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg}(z-a)]_{\gamma}
  = \theta(1) - \theta(0)
  $$
where $\theta$ is a continous choice of $z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg}(z-a)$ 
on $\gamma.$

**Proof (unambiguous definition).**
If $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are two continuous choices of 
$z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg}(z-a)$ on $\gamma,$
for any $t \in [0,1],$ they differ of a multiple of $2\pi.$
As the function $\theta_1  - \theta_2$ is continuous, 
by the intermediate value theorem, it is constant.
Hence $$(\theta_1 - \theta_2)(1) = (\theta_1 - \theta_2)(0),$$
and $\theta_1(1) - \theta_1(0) = \theta_2(1) - \theta_2(0).$
\hfill $\blacksquare$

**Definition -- Winding Number / Index.** 
Let $a \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\gamma$ be a closed path of 
$\mathbb{C} \setminus \{a\}.$
The *winding number* -- or *index* -- of $\gamma$ around $a$ is the integer 
  $$
  \mathrm{ind}(\gamma,a)
   = \frac{1}{2\pi}[z\mapsto \mathrm{Arg}(z-a)]_{\gamma}.
  $$

**Proof -- The Winding Number is an Integer.**
Let $\theta$ be a continuous choice function of $z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg}(z-a)$ 
on $\gamma;$
as the path $\gamma$ is closed, $\theta(0)$ and $\theta(1),$
which are values of the argument of $\gamma(0)-a = \gamma(1)-a,$
are equal modulo $2\pi,$ hence $(\theta(1) - \theta(0))/2\pi$ is an integer.
\hfill $\blacksquare$

**Definition -- Path Exterior & Interior.** 
The *exterior* and *interior* of a closed path $\gamma$ 
are the subsets of the complex plane defined by
  $$
  \mathrm{Ext} \, \gamma 
  = 
  \{ 
    z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma([0,1]) 
    \; | \;
    \mathrm{ind}(\gamma, z) = 0 
  \}.
  $$
and
  $$
  \mathrm{Int} \, \gamma 
  =
  \mathbb{C} \setminus (\gamma([0,1]) \cup \mathrm{Ext} \, \gamma) 
  =
  \{ 
    z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma([0,1]) 
    \; | \;
    \mathrm{ind}(\gamma, z) \neq 0 
  \}.
  $$


Properties
================================================================================

**Theorem -- The Winding Number is Locally Constant.** 
Let $a \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\gamma$ be a closed path of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{a\}.$
There is a $\epsilon > 0$ such that, 
for any $b \in \mathbb{C}$ and any closed path $\beta,$ if
  $$
  |b - a| < \epsilon 
  \; \mbox{ and } \; 
  (\forall \, t \in [0,1], \; |\beta(t) - \gamma(t)| < \epsilon)
  $$
then $\beta$ is a path of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{b\}$ and
  $$
  \mathrm{ind}(\gamma,a) = \mathrm{ind}(\beta,b).
  $$

**Proof.** 
Let $\epsilon = d(a, \gamma([0,1])) /2.$ 
If $|b - a| < \epsilon$ and for any $t \in [0,1],$ 
$|\gamma(t) - \beta(t)| < \epsilon,$ then clearly
$b \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \beta([0,1]).$
Additionally, for any $t \in [0,1]$
there are values $\theta_1$ of $\mathrm{Arg} (\gamma(t)-a)$
and $\theta_2$ of $\mathrm{Arg}(\beta(t)-b)$ such that 
$|\theta_1 - \theta_2| < \pi/2.$
If we select some values $\theta_{1,0}$ of $\mathrm{Arg} (\gamma(0) - a)$ and 
$\theta_{2,0}$ of $\mathrm{Arg} (\beta(0) -b)$ such that 
$|\theta_{1,0} - \theta_{2,0}| < \pi/2,$
then the corresponding continuous choices $\theta_1$ et $\theta_2$ satisfy
$|\theta_1(t) - \theta_2(t)| < \pi/2$ for any $t \in [0,1]$([^lemma]).
Consequently
  $$
  |\mathrm{ind}(\gamma,a) - \mathrm{ind}(\beta,b)| = 
  \left|
    \frac{\theta_1(1) - \theta_1(0)}{2\pi} - 
    \frac{\theta_2(1) - \theta_2(0)}{2\pi}
  \right| < 
  \frac{1}{2}.
  $$
As both winding numbers are integers, they are equal.
\hfill $\blacksquare$

[^lemma]: Otherwise, by the intermediate value theorem, we could find some 
$t \in \left]0,1\right]$ such that $|\theta_1(t) - \theta_2(t)| = \pi/2,$
but then, for every value $\theta_{1,t}$ of $\mathrm{Arg} (\gamma(t)-a)$
and $\theta_{2,t}$ of $\mathrm{Arg}(\beta(t)-b),$ we would have
$$\theta_{1,t}- \theta_{2,t} = \theta_1(t) - \theta_2(t) + 2\pi k$$ for
some $k \in \mathbb{Z}.$ 
Therefore, the choice of $\theta_{1,t}$ and $\theta_{2,t}$
such that $|\theta_{1,t} - \theta_{2,t}| < \pi/2$ would be impossible.




**Corollary -- The Winding Number is Constant on Components.** 
Let $\gamma$ be a closed path. 
The function 
  $$
  z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma([0,1]) \mapsto \mathrm{ind}(\gamma,z)
  $$
is constant on each component of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma([0,1])$.
If additionally the component is unbounded, the value of the winding
number is zero.

**Proof.** 
The mapping $z \mapsto \mathrm{ind}(\gamma, z)$ is locally constant -- 
and hence constant -- 
on every connected component of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma([0,1]).$
If $a$ belongs to some unbounded component of this set, 
there is a $b$ in the same component such that
$|b|> r = \max_{t \in [0,1]} |\gamma(t)|.$
It is possible to connect $b$ to any point $c$ such that $|c| = r$ 
by a circular path in $\mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma([0,1]),$
thus we may assume that $b \in \mathbb{R}_-.$
The function
  $$
  \theta: t \in [0,1] \mapsto \mathrm{arg}(\gamma(t) - b)
  $$
is a continuous choice of $z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg}(z-b)$ along $\gamma$
and it satisfies 
  $$
  \forall \,  t \in [0,1], \; |\theta(t)|  = 
  \arctan \frac{\mathrm{Im} (\gamma(t) - b)}{\mathrm{Re} (\gamma(t) -b )} < \arctan \frac{r}{|b| - r} < \frac{\pi}{2}.
  $$
As $\gamma$ is a closed path, $\theta(0)$ and $\theta(1)$
-- which are equal modulo $2\pi$ -- are actually equal and
  $$
  \mathrm{ind}(\gamma, a) = \mathrm{ind}(\gamma, b) = \frac{\theta(1) - \theta(0)}{2\pi} =0
  $$
as expected.
\hfill $\blacksquare$


Simply Connected Sets
================================================================================

**Definition -- Simply/Multiply Connected Set & Holes.‌** 
Let $\Omega$ be an open subset of the plane.
A *hole* of $\Omega$ is a bounded component of its complement 
$\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega.$
The set $\Omega$ is *simply connected* if it has no
hole (if every component of its complement is unbounded) 
and *multiply connected* otherwise. 

**Examples.**

 1. The open set 
    $\Omega = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \; | \; x < -1 \, \mbox{ or }\, x>1\}$
    is not connected but it is simply connected: its complement has 
    a unique component which is unbounded, hence it has no holes.

 3. The open set 
    $\Omega = \mathbb{C} \setminus \overline{\{2^{-n} \, | \, n \in \mathbb{N}\}}$
    is multiply connected: its holes are exactly the singletons of
    its complement. 

Intuitively, we should be able to circle around any hole of $\Omega$
without leaving the set; 
this idea leads to an alternate characterization of simply connected sets.

**Theorem -- Simply Connected Sets & The Winding Number.** 
An open subset $\Omega$ of the complex plane is simply connected if and only if
the interior of any closed path $\gamma$ of $\Omega$ is included in $\Omega$:
  $$
  \forall \, z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma([0,1]),\;
  \mathrm{ind}(\gamma, z) \neq 0 \, \Rightarrow \, z \in \Omega,
  $$
or equivalently, if the complement of $\Omega$ is included in 
the exterior of $\gamma$:
  $$
  \forall \, z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega, \; \mathrm{ind}(\gamma, z) = 0.
  $$

**Examples.**

 1. If $\gamma$ is a closed path of
    $\Omega = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \; | \; x < -1 \, \mbox{ or }\, x>1\}$
    and $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$,
    since $\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$ is connected and unbounded, 
    $z$ belongs to an unbounded component of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma([0,1]).$
    Thus $\mathrm{ind}(\gamma, z)=0$ for any $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega.$

 3. The open set 
    $\Omega = \mathbb{C} \setminus \overline{\{2^{-n} \, | \, n \in \mathbb{N}\}}$
    is open and multiply connected: for example 
    $\gamma = 1 + 1/4 [\circlearrowleft]$ is a path of $\Omega$,
    $z=1$ is a point of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$
    and $\mathrm{ind}(\gamma, 1) = 1.$

**Remark.** Note that we may not always be able to encircle only one hole at 
a time. 
For example, in the case of the set
$\Omega = \mathbb{C} \setminus \overline{\{2^{-n} \, | \, n \in \mathbb{N}\}},$
we can find a closed path $\gamma$
of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$ such that $\mathrm{ind}(\gamma, 0)=1,$
but then we also have $\mathrm{ind}(\gamma, 2^{-n})=1$ for $n$ large
enough: we cannot encircle the hole $\{0\}$ of $\Omega$ unless we also
encircle an infinity of extra holes.

**Lemma.**
If the compact set $K$ is a hole of the open set $\Omega$,
there is a compact subset $L$ of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$ 
such that $K\subset L$ and $d(L, (\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega) \setminus L) > 0.$ 

**Proof of the Lemma.**
The set $C = \mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$ is closed in $\mathbb{C}$ 
which is locally compact, thus it is locally compact.
Since $\mathbb{C}$ is Hausdorff, its subspace $C$ is also Hausdorff.
By the Šura-Bura theorem [@Rem91, p. 304],
$K$ has a neighbourhood base in $C$
consisting in open compact subsets of $C$. 
Since $C$ is a neighbourhood of $K$ in $C$, 
there is a compact set $L$ such that 
$K \subset L \subset C$ which is open in $C$.
Thus, its complement
$(\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega) \setminus L$ is also closed in $C$.
Since $C$ is closed, both sets are also closed in $\mathbb{C}$.
They are also disjoint by construction, 
and thus $d(L, (\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega) \setminus L) > 0.$ 
\hfill $\blacksquare$


**Proof -- Simply Connected Sets & The Winding Number.** 
Assume that $\Omega$ is simply connected and let $\gamma$ be a closed path
of $\Omega$.
Let $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega;$ this point belongs to an unbounded
connected component of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$ and therefore to an
unbounded connected component of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma([0,1]),$
thus $\mathrm{ind}(\gamma, z)=0.$

Conversely, if $\Omega$ is not simply connected, 
the set $\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$ has a hole $K$ which is contained
in some compact subset $L$ of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega$ such that
the distance $\epsilon$ between $L$ and 
$(\mathbb{C} \setminus \Omega) \setminus L$ is positive.
Let $r < \epsilon/\sqrt{2};$ 
Define for any pair $(k, l)$ of integers the node
$n_{k,l} = (k + i l)r$ and $S_{k,l}$ as the closed square with
vertices $n_{k,l},$ $n_{k+1,l},$ $n_{k+1,l+1}$ and $n_{k,l+1}.$
The (positively) oriented boundary of the square $S_{k,l}$ is the
polyline
  $$
  [n_{k,l} \to n_{k+1,l} \to n_{k+1,l+1} \to n_{k,l+1} \to n_{k,l}]
  $$
The collection of squares that intersect $L$ is finite and covers $L.$ 
Additionally, all of its squares are included in $\Omega \cup L.$

For any square $S$ in the cover of $L$ and any interior point $a$ of $S$
if $\gamma$ is the oriented boundary of $S,$ 
then $\mathrm{ind}(\gamma, a) = 1.$ 
Additionally, 
$\mathrm{ind}(\mu, a) = 0$ for the oriented boundary $\mu$ of any other
square in the collection. Consequently, if $\Gamma$ denotes the collection 
of oriented line segments that composes the oriented boundaries of all
squares of the cover of $L,$ we have
  $$
  \sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma}\frac{1}{2\pi} [z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg}(z-a)]_{\gamma} = 1.
  $$
Now if the line segment $\gamma$ belongs to $\Gamma$ and 
$\gamma([0,1]) \cap L \neq \varnothing,$ then 
$\gamma^{\leftarrow}$ also belongs to $\Gamma;$ 
if we remove all such pairs from $\Gamma,$ the resulting collection 
$\Gamma'$ also satisfies
  $$
  \sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma'}\frac{1}{2\pi} [z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg}(z-a)]_{\gamma} = 1.
  $$
and by construction the image of any $\gamma$ in $\Gamma'$ is included in
$\Omega.$ The original collection $\Gamma$ is balanced: for any square
vertice $n,$ the number of line segments with $n$ as an initial point and
with $n$ as a terminal point is the same. The collection $\Gamma'$ has
the same property. Consequently, the line segments of $\Gamma'$ may
be assembled in a finite sequence of closed paths $\gamma_1,$ $\dots,$
$\gamma_n$ and
  $$
  \sum_{k=1}^n \mathrm{ind}(\gamma_k, a) = 1.
  $$
Every point of $L$ is either an interior point of some square of the collection,
or the limit of such point; anyway, that means that
  $$
  \forall \, z \in L, \; \sum_{k=1}^n \mathrm{ind}(\gamma_k, z) = 1
  $$
and thus that there is at least one path $\gamma_k$ such that
  $\mathrm{ind}(\gamma_k, z) \neq 0.$
\hfill $\blacksquare$

A Complex Analytic Approach
================================================================================

If a closed path is rectifiable, we may compute its winding number 
as a line integral; to prove this, we need the:

**Lemma.** 
Let $a \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\gamma$ be a rectifiable path of 
$\mathbb{C} \setminus \{a\}.$
For any $t \in [0,1],$ let $\gamma_t$ be the path such that for any $s\in[0,1],$
$\gamma_t(s) = \gamma(t s).$ 
The function $\mu:[0,1]\to \mathbb{C},$ defined by
  $$
  \mu(t) = \int_{\gamma_t} \frac{dz}{z-a}
  $$
satisfies
  $$
  \exists \, \lambda \in \mathbb{C}^*, \,
  \forall \, t \in [0,1], \,
  e^{\mu(t)} = \lambda \times (\gamma(t) - a).
  $$

**Proof.** 
We only prove the lemma under the assumption that $\gamma$ is continuously 
differentiable; 
the rectifiable case is a straightforward extension.

We have for any $t\in [0,1]$
  $$
  \mu(t) = \int_{\gamma_t} \frac{dz}{z-a}
  =
  \int_0^1 \frac{\gamma'(ts) \times t}{\gamma(t s) - a} ds
  =
  \int_0^t \frac{\gamma'(s)}{\gamma(s) - a} ds,
  $$
hence
  $$
  \mu'(t) = \frac{\gamma'(t)}{\gamma(t) - a}
  $$
and the derivative of the quotient
$\phi(t) = {e^{\mu(t)}}/{(\gamma(t)}-a)$ satisfies
  $$
  \phi'(t)
  =
  \mu'(t) \phi(t)
  -
  \frac{\gamma'(t)}{\gamma(t) - a} \phi(t)
  = 0
  $$
which yields the result. \hfill $\blacksquare$


**Theorem -- The Winding Number as a Line Integral.** 
Let $a \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\gamma$ be a  rectifiable 
path of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{a\}.$ Then
  $$
  [z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg} (z-a)]_{\gamma} = \mathrm{Im} \left( \int_{\gamma} \frac{dz}{z - a} \right). 
  $$
If the path $\gamma$ is closed, then
  $$
  \mathrm{ind}(\gamma,a) = 
  \frac{1}{i2\pi} \int_{\gamma} \frac{dz}{z - a}. 
  $$

**Proof.** We use the function $\mu$ of the previous lemma. 
Applying the modulus to both sides of the equation
$e^{\mu(t)} = \lambda \times (\gamma(t) - a)$ 
provides $e^{\mathrm{Re}(\mu(t))} = |\lambda| \times |\gamma(t) - a|,$
hence
  $$
  e^{i \mathrm{Im}(\mu(t))} = \frac{\lambda}{|\lambda|} \frac{\gamma(t) - a}{|\gamma(t) - a|}.
  $$
The function $t \in [0,1] \mapsto \mathrm{Im}(\mu(t))$ is -- up to a constant -- 
a continuous choice of $z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg}\, (z-a)$ on $\gamma.$ 
Consequently,
$$[z \mapsto \mathrm{Arg} \, (z-a)]_{\gamma} = \mathrm{Im}(\mu(1)) - \mathrm{Im}(\mu(0))
= \mathrm{Im}(\mu(1)),$$
which is the desired result. 

If additionally $\gamma$ is a closed path, the equations 
  $$
  \gamma(0) = \gamma(1) \; \mbox{ and } \;
  e^{\mathrm{Re}(\mu(t))} = |\lambda| \times |\gamma(t) - a|
  $$ 
yield $e^{\mathrm{Re}(\mu(0))}= e^{\mathrm{Re}(\mu(1))}$
and hence $\mathrm{Re}(\mu(1)) = \mathrm{Re}(\mu(0)) = 0.$ 
Thus,
  $$
  \mathrm{ind}(\gamma,a) = 
  \frac{1}{2\pi} \mathrm{Im}(\mu(1)) = \frac{1}{i2\pi} \mu(1),
  $$
which concludes the proof. \hfill $\blacksquare$
